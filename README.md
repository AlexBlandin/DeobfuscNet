### Installation A

Open in Colab. Run All. Done.

Changing parameters using the drop-down menus is preferred.

### Installation B

Good luck. Colab-specific syntax is used (`!wget`, `!pip`, etc.), these can be removed if the required files are present in the local directory. DOWNLOAD options should "fail gracefully" outside of Colab. Ensure Tensorflow2 is installed alongside all other required modules (py-ulid, tqdm, numpy, sklearn, skimage, matplotlib). Ensure Weasyprint is installed with all requirements as per its [installation requirements](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).
